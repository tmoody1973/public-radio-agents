# Donor Data Analysis Process

## Overview

Donor data analysis transforms raw giving information into actionable insights that drive strategic fundraising decisions. This systematic approach helps identify patterns, predict behavior, and optimize cultivation and solicitation strategies for maximum impact and efficiency.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Essential Data Points
**Basic Donor Information**:
- Name, address, and contact information
- First gift date and acquisition source
- Total giving history by year and campaign
- Gift frequency and timing patterns
- Communication preferences and restrictions

**Demographic Data**:
- Age and generation cohort
- Geographic location and proximity to station
- Estimated income and wealth indicators
- Professional background and employer information
- Family status and household composition

**Engagement Metrics**:
- Event attendance history
- Volunteer participation
- Website and email engagement
- Social media interactions
- Program preferences and listening habits

### Data Quality Assessment
**Accuracy Verification**:
- Check for duplicate records and merge as appropriate
- Verify contact information currency and accuracy
- Standardize data formats and naming conventions
- Identify and flag incomplete or questionable records
- Update records with most recent information available

**Completeness Evaluation**:
- Assess percentage of records with complete contact information
- Identify gaps in giving history or demographic data
- Prioritize data enhancement efforts based on donor value
- Develop strategies for collecting missing information
- Set data quality standards and improvement goals

## Segmentation Analysis

### Giving Level Segmentation
**Standard Categories**:
- **Major donors**: Top 10% of donors by cumulative giving
- **Mid-level donors**: Next 20% of donors by giving capacity
- **Regular members**: Consistent annual donors below mid-level threshold
- **New donors**: First-time supporters within last 12 months
- **Lapsed donors**: Previous supporters who haven't given in 18+ months

**Custom Segmentation**:
- **Sustaining members**: Monthly recurring donors
- **Event supporters**: Donors who primarily give through events
- **Program-specific**: Donors who support particular shows or initiatives
- **Corporate connections**: Individual donors with business relationships
- **Legacy prospects**: Donors with planned giving potential

### Behavioral Segmentation
**Giving Patterns**:
- **Frequency**: Annual, bi-annual, or irregular giving patterns
- **Timing**: Seasonal preferences and response to specific appeals
- **Channel preference**: Mail, online, phone, or event giving
- **Upgrade history**: Donors who have increased giving over time
- **Retention patterns**: Length of giving relationship and consistency

**Engagement Levels**:
- **Highly engaged**: Multiple touchpoints and active participation
- **Moderately engaged**: Regular giving with some additional involvement
- **Transactional**: Giving only with minimal other engagement
- **At-risk**: Declining engagement or giving patterns
- **Re-engagement candidates**: Lapsed donors with strong historical connection

### Demographic Analysis
**Age Cohort Patterns**:
- **Silent Generation (born 1928-1945)**: Highest per-capita giving, traditional communication preferences
- **Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964)**: Large donor base, transitioning to legacy giving
- **Generation X (born 1965-1980)**: Growing giving capacity, busy lifestyles
- **Millennials (born 1981-1996)**: Emerging donors, digital-first preferences
- **Generation Z (born 1997-2012)**: New prospects, social media engagement

**Geographic Segmentation**:
- **Primary coverage area**: Core listening audience with strongest connection
- **Secondary markets**: Adjacent areas with some signal coverage
- **National supporters**: Donors outside coverage area with mission connection
- **Urban vs. rural**: Different giving patterns and communication preferences
- **Proximity analysis**: Distance from station and event attendance correlation

## Performance Metrics and KPIs

### Donor Retention Analysis
**Retention Rates**:
- **Overall retention**: Percentage of donors who give again within 12 months
- **First-year retention**: Critical metric for new donor cultivation success
- **Multi-year retention**: Donors who give consistently over multiple years
- **Reactivation rate**: Percentage of lapsed donors who resume giving
- **Upgrade retention**: Retention of donors who increase their giving

**Retention Factors**:
- Correlation between gift size and retention rates
- Impact of stewardship activities on donor retention
- Communication frequency and retention relationship
- Event attendance and retention correlation
- Volunteer involvement and giving persistence

### Lifetime Value Calculations
**Basic LTV Formula**:
```
LTV = (Average Annual Gift Ã— Average Donor Lifespan) - Acquisition Cost
```

**Enhanced LTV Considerations**:
- **Upgrade potential**: Historical patterns of gift increases
- **Referral value**: New donors brought in by existing supporters
- **Volunteer contribution**: Monetary value of time donated
- **Advocacy impact**: Word-of-mouth promotion and community influence
- **Legacy potential**: Probability of planned gift inclusion

### Campaign Performance Analysis
**Response Rates**:
- **Overall response**: Percentage of solicited donors who respond
- **Channel comparison**: Mail vs. email vs. phone vs. online response rates
- **Segment performance**: Response rates by donor category
- **Message testing**: A/B testing results for different appeals
- **Timing analysis**: Optimal days and times for different donor segments

**Revenue Analysis**:
- **Average gift size**: By segment, channel, and campaign type
- **Revenue per solicitation**: Total revenue divided by number of solicitations
- **Cost per dollar raised**: Fundraising expenses relative to revenue generated
- **Net revenue**: Total revenue minus all associated costs
- **ROI by channel**: Return on investment for different fundraising methods

## Predictive Analytics

### Donor Scoring Models
**Propensity to Give Scoring**:
- **Recency**: How recently the donor last gave
- **Frequency**: How often the donor gives
- **Monetary**: Average and total giving amounts
- **Engagement**: Level of involvement beyond giving
- **Demographics**: Age, location, and other relevant factors

**Upgrade Probability**:
- Historical upgrade patterns and timing
- Engagement level and stewardship response
- External factors (income changes, life events)
- Peer comparison and social influence factors
- Campaign timing and messaging alignment

### Churn Prediction
**Risk Factors**:
- **Declining gift amounts**: Gradual reduction in giving levels
- **Increased time between gifts**: Lengthening intervals between donations
- **Reduced engagement**: Lower email open rates, event attendance
- **Communication preferences**: Requests to reduce contact frequency
- **Life changes**: Age, relocation, or other demographic shifts

**Early Warning Indicators**:
- Donors who skip their usual giving season
- Significant decrease in gift amount without explanation
- Bounced emails or returned mail
- Complaints or negative feedback
- Reduced response to stewardship communications

### Acquisition Modeling
**Prospect Identification**:
- **Look-alike modeling**: Finding prospects similar to best donors
- **Geographic analysis**: Areas with high donor concentration
