### Quantitative Performance Analysis

#### Audience Delivery Assessment
1. **Reach and Frequency Calculations**
   ```
   Weekly Cume Reach = Unduplicated listeners exposed to acknowledgments
   Average Frequency = Total impressions ÷ Weekly cume reach

3. **Cost Efficiency Metrics**
   ```
   Cost Per Thousand (CPM) = (Total Investment ÷ Total Impressions) × 1,000
   Cost Per Point (CPP) = Total Investment ÷ Total GRPs
   Cost Per Reach = Total Investment ÷ Weekly Cume Reach
   Efficiency Index = (Target CPM ÷ Actual CPM) × 100
   ```
