# Public Radio Underwriting Knowledge Base

## Overview of Public Radio Underwriting

### Definition and Purpose
**Underwriting** is the practice of acknowledging businesses and organizations that provide financial support to public radio stations. Unlike commercial advertising, underwriting acknowledgments are strictly regulated by the FCC and must be informational rather than promotional.

**Key Principles**:
- **Value-neutral identification**: Acknowledgments identify supporters without promoting their products or services
- **Community partnership**: Underwriting creates mutually beneficial relationships between stations and local businesses
- **Mission alignment**: Supporters are attracted to the station's values and audience quality
- **Revenue diversification**: Provides crucial funding stream alongside membership and grants

### Regulatory Framework
**FCC Guidelines (Section 73.503)**:
- **Identification only**: Acknowledgments may identify but not promote
- **No calls to action**: Cannot include language encouraging listeners to buy or visit
- **No comparative claims**: Cannot use superlatives or competitive language
- **No price information**: Cannot mention costs, discounts, or special offers

**Permitted Content**:
- Business name and location
- Contact information (phone, website, address)
- Value-neutral description of products or services
- Logos and established slogans (if not promotional)
- Neutral factual information about the business
