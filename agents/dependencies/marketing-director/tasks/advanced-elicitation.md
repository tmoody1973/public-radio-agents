# Advanced Elicitation Process for Marketing

## Overview

Advanced elicitation in marketing context involves sophisticated techniques for understanding audience motivations, preferences, community needs, and engagement patterns. This process goes beyond surface-level demographics to uncover the deeper psychological and cultural drivers that influence audience behavior and community connection with public radio.

## Preparation Phase

### Research Foundation
**Before the Conversation**:
- Review existing audience data, listening patterns, and engagement history
- Research community demographics, cultural dynamics, and local media landscape
- Identify potential connection points and shared community interests
- Prepare open-ended questions tailored to specific community segments
- Set clear objectives for understanding audience needs and motivations

**Environmental Setup**:
- Choose comfortable, accessible locations for conversations (community centers, local events, station spaces)
- Minimize distractions and create welcoming atmosphere
- Allow adequate time for in-depth discussions
- Prepare materials that might be helpful (program samples, community impact stories)
- Plan follow-up engagement opportunities

### Question Development
**Primary Areas of Inquiry**:
- Personal connection to public radio and community media
- Information and entertainment preferences and consumption habits
- Community involvement, values, and priorities
- Media trust, credibility, and source preferences
- Barriers to engagement and participation

**Question Types**:
- **Open-ended**: "What role does local media play in your daily life?"
- **Probing**: "Can you tell me more about that community issue?"
- **Hypothetical**: "If you could design the perfect local radio station, what would it include?"
- **Reflective**: "It sounds like community connection is really important to you."

## Conversation Framework

### Opening and Rapport Building
**Establish Comfort**:
- Begin with genuine appreciation for their community involvement
- Share brief, relevant personal connection to the community
- Ask about their current interests or recent community experiences
- Listen for cues about their communication style and cultural preferences

**Example Opening**:
"Thank you so much for taking time to talk with me today. I've been looking forward to this conversation because I know how much you care about our community. Before we talk about media and information, I'd love to hear what's been happening in your neighborhood lately and what issues are on your mind."

### Core Elicitation Techniques

#### The Community-Centered Funnel Approach
**Start Broad, Narrow Down**:
1. **Community connection**: "What do you love most about living in this community?"
2. **Information needs**: "How do you like to stay informed about what's happening locally?"
3. **Media preferences**: "What sources do you trust for news and information?"
4. **Public radio awareness**: "What's your experience with public radio been like?"

#### Active Listening Strategies
**Verbal Techniques**:
- **Paraphrasing**: "So if I understand correctly, you're saying community events are where you feel most connected..."
- **Clarifying**: "When you mention local representation, what does that look like to you?"
- **Summarizing**: "Let me make sure I've captured the key things you care about..."
- **Encouraging**: "That's a really important perspective. Can you share more about that experience?"

**Non-Verbal Awareness**:
- Maintain culturally appropriate eye contact and open body language
- Notice changes in energy when discussing different topics
- Pay attention to what community issues generate the most passion
- Observe comfort level with different types of questions and adjust accordingly
