# Advanced Elicitation Process

## Overview

Advanced elicitation is a sophisticated approach to understanding donor motivations, capacity, and interests through strategic questioning and active listening. This process goes beyond basic demographic information to uncover the deeper psychological and emotional drivers that influence giving decisions.

## Preparation Phase

### Research Foundation
**Before the Conversation**:
- Review all available donor history and interaction records
- Research donor's professional background and public information
- Identify potential connection points and shared interests
- Prepare open-ended questions tailored to the individual
- Set clear objectives for what you hope to learn

**Environmental Setup**:
- Choose comfortable, private setting for conversation
- Minimize distractions and interruptions
- Allow adequate time for unhurried discussion
- Prepare materials that might be helpful (annual reports, program information)
- Plan follow-up actions and next steps

### Question Development
**Primary Areas of Inquiry**:
- Personal connection to public radio and station mission
- Values and priorities that drive philanthropic decisions
- Giving history and patterns with other organizations
- Family and personal circumstances affecting giving capacity
- Professional interests and expertise that might benefit the station

**Question Types**:
- **Open-ended**: "What first drew you to public radio?"
- **Probing**: "Can you tell me more about that experience?"
- **Hypothetical**: "If you could design the perfect public radio station, what would it include?"
- **Reflective**: "It sounds like community connection is really important to you."

## Conversation Framework

### Opening and Rapport Building
**Establish Comfort**:
- Begin with genuine appreciation for their support
- Share brief, relevant personal connection to the station
- Ask about their current interests or recent experiences
- Listen for cues about their communication style and preferences

**Example Opening**:
"Thank you so much for taking time to meet with me today. I've been looking forward to this conversation because I know how much you care about our station's mission. Before we talk about the station, I'd love to hear how you've been and what's been keeping you busy lately."

### Core Elicitation Techniques

#### The Funnel Approach
**Start Broad, Narrow Down**:
1. **General interests**: "What issues or causes are most important to you?"
2. **Media preferences**: "How do you like to stay informed about current events?"
3. **Public radio connection**: "What role does public radio play in your daily life?"
4. **Station-specific**: "What programs or aspects of our station do you value most?"

#### Active Listening Strategies
**Verbal Techniques**:
- **Paraphrasing**: "So if I understand correctly, you're saying..."
- **Clarifying**: "When you mention community impact, what does that look like to you?"
- **Summarizing**: "Let me make sure I've captured the key points..."
- **Encouraging**: "That's a fascinating perspective. Can you elaborate?"

**Non-Verbal Awareness**:
- Maintain appropriate eye contact and open body language
- Notice changes in energy or enthusiasm during conversation
- Pay attention to what topics generate the most engagement
- Observe comfort level with different types of questions

#### Capacity Assessment Techniques
**Indirect Approaches**:
- **Lifestyle indicators**: Travel, hobbies, home, and professional activities
- **Giving patterns**: History with other organizations and causes

**Direct but Respectful Inquiry**:
- "What level of giving feels comfortable and meaningful to you?"
- "How do you typically approach your philanthropic planning?"
- "What factors do you consider when making larger charitable commitments?"

#### Emotional Connection Points
**Personal Story Elicitation**:

- "What moment made you realize you wanted to support our station?"
- "How has your relationship with public radio evolved over the years?"
- "What would be lost if our station wasn't here?"

#### Future Vision Questions

- "Are there station events or programs you'd like to help shape?"
- "Would you be interested in connecting us with others who share your interests?"

### Family and Social Dynamics

#### Family Philanthropy Patterns
**Household Decision Making**:
- "How do you and your spouse/partner approach charitable giving decisions?"
- "Are there family traditions around philanthropy that influence your giving?"
- "Do your children share your interest in public radio?"
