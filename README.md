# Public Radio Agents 📻

> AI-powered management consultants for public radio stations

A specialized adaptation of the BMAd-Method™ framework designed specifically for public radio station management. This system provides four expert AI agents that can assist with development, marketing, underwriting, and programming decisions.

## 🎯 What This System Does

Transform any Large Language Model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) into a team of specialized public radio consultants:

- **Development Director** 💝 - Fundraising strategy, donor relations, membership campaigns
- **Marketing Director** 📢 - Audience development, brand management, digital marketing  
- **Underwriting Director** 🤝 - Corporate partnerships, sponsorship sales, business development
- **Program Director** 🎙️ - Programming strategy, content development, talent management

## ⚡ Enhanced with MCP Integration

**Take it to the next level**: Connect your agents to real station data using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Basic Mode**: General advice based on public radio best practices
**MCP Mode**: Data-driven recommendations using your actual station information

### What MCP Enables
- **Real Data Analysis**: Connect to donor databases, financial reports, audience metrics
- **Document Access**: Analyze past campaigns, grant applications, strategic plans
- **Live Research**: Real-time sponsor research and competitive analysis
- **Automated Insights**: Generate reports using your actual performance data

### Example Transformation
**Without MCP**: *"Based on industry standards, focus on donor retention"*
**With MCP**: *"Your database shows 127 lapsed donors from 2023 who gave $50+. Here's a specific re-engagement strategy for each segment."*
