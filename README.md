# Public Radio Agents 📻

> AI-powered management consultants for public radio stations

## The Origin Story

The Public Radio Agents system emerged from a simple question that led down a fascinating rabbit hole: *What if we could democratize access to expert-level strategic guidance for public radio?*

Public radio stations today face unprecedented challenges—managing complex fundraising campaigns, developing audiences in fragmented media landscapes, building corporate partnerships, and making programming decisions—all while operating with skeleton crews and shrinking budgets. Meanwhile, the AI revolution is creating opportunities to access sophisticated expertise that was previously available only to well-funded organizations.

The answer became something unexpected: a complete AI-powered management consulting system specifically designed for public radio stations.

## Why This Matters Now

The timing couldn't be more critical. With CPB funding uncertainty and many stations classified as "vulnerable," public radio needs every strategic advantage available. The stations that will survive and thrive are those that can operate more strategically, more efficiently, and with better coordination between departments.

This system doesn't replace human expertise—it amplifies it. A development director can brainstorm campaign strategies, test messaging approaches, and develop donor stewardship plans. Marketing directors can optimize digital campaigns and build audience engagement. Station managers can coordinate complex initiatives across all departments.

## The Open Source Advantage

Here's where this gets revolutionary: **we're making the entire system open source and freely available to the public radio community.**

This represents a new model for how public radio can leverage AI—not as a replacement for human judgment, but as a force multiplier that makes sophisticated strategic thinking accessible to every station, regardless of size or budget.

A specialized adaptation of the [BMAd-Method™](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/main) framework designed specifically for public radio station management.

## 🎯 Meet Your AI Management Team

Transform any Large Language Model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) into four specialized public radio consultants, each with deep expertise in critical areas of station management:

**💝 Sarah, the Development Director**  
Specializes in fundraising strategy, donor relations, membership campaigns, and grant writing. She understands the psychology of public radio giving and develops sophisticated strategies that go far beyond traditional pledge drives.

**📢 Marcus, the Marketing Director**  
Focuses on audience development, brand management, digital marketing, and community engagement. He knows how to build sustainable audience growth in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.

**🤝 Diana, the Underwriting Director**  
Expert in corporate partnerships, sponsorship development, and business relationships. She helps stations diversify revenue streams and build meaningful partnerships with local businesses.

**🎙️ Jordan, the Program Director**  
Handles programming strategy, content development, talent management, and audience research. They understand how to create programming that builds community connection and drives listener loyalty.

## ⚡ Enhanced with MCP Integration

**Take it to the next level**: Connect your agents to real station data using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Basic Mode**: General advice based on public radio best practices
**MCP Mode**: Data-driven recommendations using your actual station information

### What MCP Enables
- **Real Data Analysis**: Connect to donor databases, financial reports, audience metrics
- **Document Access**: Analyze past campaigns, grant applications, strategic plans
- **Live Research**: Real-time sponsor research and competitive analysis
- **Automated Insights**: Generate reports using your actual performance data

### Example Transformation
**Without MCP**: *"Based on industry standards, focus on donor retention"*
**With MCP**: *"Your database shows 127 lapsed donors from 2023 who gave $50+. Here's a specific re-engagement strategy for each segment."*

## 🔧 Development and Customization

### Build Script for Custom Modifications

The `build-bundle.py` script is for public radio professionals who want to customize the framework for their specific station needs.

**When you might use this:**
- Adding local market information (business landscape, community partnerships)
- Creating custom templates that match your station's processes  
- Modifying agent personalities to reflect your station's culture
- Adding specialized knowledge for your region or format

**Basic usage:**
```bash
# After making changes to agent files, rebuild the framework
python3 scripts/build-bundle.py
```

**💡 Most users don't need this!** The standard `publicradio.txt` file works perfectly for normal use with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI services.

## 🌟 The Bigger Picture

This project represents something larger than just a useful tool for public radio stations. It's a proof of concept for how AI can democratize expertise in specialized domains.

The same approach could be applied to other areas of public media: newsroom management, community engagement, digital transformation, or crisis communication. It could be adapted for other mission-driven organizations facing similar challenges.

More fundamentally, it demonstrates how AI can be used not to replace human expertise, but to make that expertise more accessible and actionable for everyone. This is the future of AI in specialized domains—not replacing professionals, but empowering them with instant access to deep, contextual knowledge.

### Quality Assurance Tools
```bash
# Validate all dependencies
python3 scripts/validate-dependencies.py

# Build complete bundle
python3 scripts/build-bundle.py

# Generate custom bundle
python3 scripts/build-bundle.py --output custom-bundle.txt
```

### Framework Statistics
- **Total Files**: 113 dependency files + core framework
- **Knowledge Base**: 15,000+ lines of expert content
- **Templates**: 40+ professional YAML templates
- **Coverage**: Complete public radio management domains
- **Validation**: Automated quality assurance and error checking
