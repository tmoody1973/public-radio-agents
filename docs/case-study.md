# Case Study: WXYZ Public Radio's Membership Recovery

> **Real-world example**: How a mid-market public radio station used the Public Radio BMAd system to recover from declining membership and build a sustainable fundraising strategy.

## Background: The Challenge

**WXYZ Public Radio** is a community-licensed station serving a metropolitan area of 250,000 people. Like many public radio stations, they faced significant challenges in 2023:

- **30% drop in membership revenue** over two years
- **Aging donor base** with limited new member acquisition
- **Ineffective digital outreach** and outdated marketing strategies
- **Siloed departments** working without coordination
- **Limited staff capacity** for strategic planning

The station's General Manager, Sarah Chen, decided to try the Public Radio BMAd system to develop a comprehensive recovery strategy.

## The Implementation: Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: System Setup and Initial Assessment

**Step 1: Loading the System**

Sarah opened ChatGPT and pasted the complete contents of `publicradio.txt`. The system immediately activated:

```
=== Public Radio Orchestrator Activated ===
Welcome! I'm your Public Radio Master Orchestrator. 
I can transform into any of our specialized director agents or guide you through structured workflows.

Available Commands (all start with *):
*help - Show all commands and agents
*agent [name] - Transform into a specialist
*workflow [name] - Start a structured process
*chat-mode - Begin conversational assistance

How can I help your station today?
```

**Step 2: Starting with Strategic Assessment**

Sarah typed: `*chat-mode`

The system responded:
```
I'm now in conversational mode. I can help you explore your challenges and recommend the best approach using our specialized agents and workflows.

What's the main challenge or opportunity you're facing at your station?
```

Sarah explained: "We've lost 30% of our membership revenue over two years. Our donor base is aging, our digital outreach isn't working, and our departments aren't coordinating well. We need a comprehensive strategy to turn this around."

The system analyzed her situation and recommended:
```
Based on your description, I recommend starting with our Annual Strategic Planning workflow, which will coordinate all four director agents to develop an integrated recovery strategy.

Would you like to:
1. Start the *workflow annual-planning process
2. Begin with the *agent development-director for immediate fundraising focus
3. Use *agent marketing-director to address digital outreach first
4. Continue this conversation to explore options further

Which approach feels right for your situation?
```

**Step 3: Choosing the Strategic Planning Workflow**

Sarah chose option 1: `*workflow annual-planning`

The system activated the comprehensive planning process:

```
=== Annual Strategic Planning Workflow Activated ===

This workflow coordinates all four director agents through four phases:
1. Environmental Analysis
2. Strategic Goal Setting  
3. Departmental Planning
4. Integration and Optimization

Phase 1: Environmental Analysis
We'll start by having each director agent assess your current situation from their perspective.

Transforming into Development Director for donor analysis...
```

### Phase 2: Environmental Analysis with Each Agent

**Development Director Analysis**

The system transformed into Sarah (Development Director):

```
Hi! I'm Sarah, your Development Director. Let's analyze your donor situation.

I need to understand your current fundraising landscape. Can you share:
1. Your current membership numbers and average gift size
2. Donor retention rates over the past 2-3 years
3. Your main fundraising channels and their performance
4. Any major donor or grant funding you currently have

This will help me identify the root causes of your revenue decline.
```

Sarah Chen provided the data:
- Current members: 1,200 (down from 1,800 in 2021)
- Average gift: $85 (down from $95)
- Retention rate: 65% (industry average is 75%)
- Main channels: On-air drives, direct mail, some email
- Major donors: 15 donors giving $1,000+ annually
- Grants: One CPB grant, small local foundation grants

The Development Director agent analyzed this and provided insights:

```
ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Key Findings:

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:
- Member acquisition has essentially stopped (losing 300 members/year)
- Below-average retention suggests stewardship problems
- Over-reliance on traditional channels
- Insufficient major donor cultivation

💡 IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES:
- Implement monthly giving program (could increase revenue 40%)
- Develop digital acquisition strategy
- Create donor journey mapping for better retention
- Expand major donor program

📋 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Launch integrated membership campaign with digital focus
2. Implement donor stewardship system
3. Develop monthly giving program
4. Create major donor cultivation plan

Shall I create detailed plans for any of these areas?
```

**Marketing Director Analysis**

The system then transformed into Marcus (Marketing Director):

```
Now I'm Marcus, your Marketing Director. The Development Director's analysis shows we need better audience engagement and acquisition strategies.

Let me assess your marketing and audience development:
1. What's your current digital presence? (website, social media, email list)
2. How do you currently promote membership drives?
3. What audience data do you collect and analyze?
4. How do you engage with your community beyond broadcasting?

This will help identify why new member acquisition has stalled.
```

After Sarah provided information about their basic website, minimal social media presence, and limited community engagement, the Marketing Director provided analysis:

```
MARKETING ANALYSIS - Key Findings:

🔴 DIGITAL GAPS:
- Website not optimized for membership conversion
- Social media presence inconsistent and not strategic
- Email list small and underutilized
- No content marketing strategy

🔴 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:
- Limited presence at community events
- No partnerships with local organizations
- Minimal listener feedback collection
- Brand messaging unclear and inconsistent

💡 OPPORTUNITIES:
- Develop integrated digital strategy
- Create content that drives engagement and membership
- Build community partnerships
- Implement audience research and feedback systems

📋 PRIORITY ACTIONS:
1. Website optimization for membership conversion
2. Social media strategy development
3. Community engagement program
4. Brand messaging clarification

Ready to develop specific strategies for any of these areas?
```

**Underwriting Director Analysis**

The system transformed into Diana (Underwriting Director):

```
I'm Diana, your Underwriting Director. I see opportunities to diversify revenue while supporting membership growth.

Tell me about your current underwriting:
1. How many active underwriters do you have?
2. What's your average underwriting package value?
3. How do you currently find and approach potential sponsors?
4. How do you integrate underwriting with other revenue streams?

Understanding this will help identify partnership opportunities that support overall revenue goals.
```

After learning about their limited underwriting program (8 active sponsors, mostly small local businesses), Diana provided insights:

```
UNDERWRITING ANALYSIS - Key Findings:

🔴 REVENUE GAPS:
- Underwriting significantly underdeveloped
- No systematic approach to prospect identification
- Limited package options and value propositions
- Poor integration with membership and marketing efforts

💡 PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:
- Local businesses want community connection
- Professional services need thought leadership platforms
- Nonprofits seek mission-aligned partnerships
- Events could provide sponsor activation opportunities

📋 STRATEGIC ACTIONS:
1. Develop tiered sponsorship packages
2. Create systematic prospect research process
3. Design sponsor benefits that add real value
4. Integrate sponsorships with membership events

This could add $50,000+ annually while supporting membership growth.
```

**Program Director Analysis**

Finally, the system became Jordan (Program Director):

```
I'm Jordan, your Program Director. Programming is crucial to membership - people support what they value.

Help me understand your programming strategy:
1. What's your current program schedule and format mix?
2. How do you measure audience engagement and satisfaction?
3. What local content do you produce?
4. How does programming support fundraising efforts?

This will show how content strategy can drive membership growth.
```

After discussing their mix of NPR programming with limited local content, Jordan analyzed:

```
PROGRAMMING ANALYSIS - Key Findings:

🔴 ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGES:
- Heavy reliance on national programming
- Limited local content that builds community connection
- No systematic audience feedback collection
- Programming not strategically aligned with fundraising

💡 CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Local news and public affairs programming
- Community spotlight features
- Interactive programming that builds relationships
- Special programming for membership drives

📋 PROGRAMMING PRIORITIES:
1. Develop signature local programming
2. Create community engagement content
3. Implement audience feedback systems
4. Align programming with fundraising calendar

Local content could increase listener loyalty and membership significantly.
```

### Phase 3: Integrated Strategy Development

### Phase 5: Campaign Execution and Results

Sarah implemented the integrated strategy over six weeks. Here's how she used the system during execution:

**Week 1-2: Pre-Campaign Setup**

Sarah used individual agents for specific tasks:

```
*agent development-director
create-donor-journey
```

This generated a comprehensive donor stewardship plan. She then used:

```
*agent marketing-director
create-content-calendar
```

This produced a detailed social media and email schedule.

**Week 3-4: Campaign Launch**

During the active campaign, Sarah used the system for real-time optimization:

```
*agent development-director
analyze-donor-data
```

The system helped her identify which messages were working best and adjust strategy mid-campaign.

**Week 5-6: Final Push and Analysis**

As the campaign concluded, Sarah used:

```
*workflow membership-campaign
```

The system guided her through proper campaign wrap-up, donor thank-you processes, and performance analysis.

## The Results: Measurable Success

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
The system's ability to analyze the situation from four different expert perspectives revealed interconnected issues that wouldn't have been obvious from a single viewpoint.

### 2. Coordinated Strategy
Rather than having each department work in isolation, the system created an integrated approach where marketing supported development goals, programming enhanced community connection, and underwriting provided additional revenue without competing with membership.

### 3. Professional Templates and Processes
The system provided professional-grade templates and workflows that would have taken months to develop internally, allowing the station to implement sophisticated strategies immediately.

### 4. Ongoing Consultation
Throughout implementation, Sarah could return to specific agents for guidance, optimization, and problem-solving, essentially having four expert consultants available 24/7.

### 5. Scalable Framework
The strategies developed weren't just for one campaign - they created sustainable systems and processes that continue to benefit the station.
