## Customization Strategies

### 1. Market Size Adaptations

#### Rural and Small Market Stations
**Challenges**: Limited resources, small staff, local focus, limited corporate sponsors

**Customizations**:
```
When working with agents, always specify:
- "We're a rural station serving [population] people"
- "Our annual budget is approximately $[amount]"
- "We have [number] full-time and [number] part-time staff"
- "Our primary challenge is [specific issue]"
```

**Agent Focus Areas**:
- **Development**: Emphasize individual donor cultivation, community events, and grant writing
- **Marketing**: Focus on local partnerships, word-of-mouth, and community presence
- **Underwriting**: Target local businesses, service providers, and community organizations
- **Programming**: Prioritize local content, community voices, and volunteer involvement

**Example Customization**:
```
*agent development-director

"I manage development for a rural public radio station in [state] serving about 15,000 people. Our annual budget is $180,000, and I'm the only full-time development staff. We rely heavily on individual donors and struggle with donor retention. Our average gift is $75, and we have about 400 active members. What strategies would work best for our situation?"
```

#### Major Market Stations
**Challenges**: High competition, sophisticated audience, complex partnerships, significant resources

**Customizations**:
```
When working with agents, always specify:
- "We're a major market station in [city] serving [population]"
- "We compete with [specific media outlets]"
- "Our audience is [demographic description]"
- "We have [staff size] and [budget range]"
```

**Agent Focus Areas**:

### 2. Programming Format Adaptations

- **Programming**: Focus on local news, community issues, and public affairs

**Customization Example**:
```
*agent marketing-director

```

#### Music Stations
**Focus Areas**:

### 3. Organizational Structure Adaptations

#### University Stations
**Special Considerations**:
- Academic calendar constraints
- Student involvement and training
- University policies and procedures
- Educational mission integration
- Limited commercial activity

**Customization Approach**:
```
*agent development-director

"We're a university-licensed public radio station. We can't do traditional underwriting but can accept educational grants and donations. We have student volunteers but limited professional staff. Our fundraising must align with university development policies. What strategies work best for our situation?"
```

#### Community Stations
**Special Considerations**:
- Volunteer-heavy operations
- Community board governance
- Local programming emphasis
- Limited professional staff
- Grassroots fundraising approach

**Customization Approach**:
```
*agent program-director

"We're a community radio station run primarily by volunteers. We have 40+ volunteer programmers and only 2 paid staff. Our programming is very local and diverse. How can we maintain quality and consistency while supporting our volunteer programmers?"
```

## Advanced Customization Techniques

### 1. Creating Station-Specific Prompts

Develop standardized prompts that include your station's key information:

**Template**:
```
Station Context:
- Market: [Rural/Small/Medium/Major] market serving [population]
- Format: [News/Music/Mixed] with focus on [specific areas]
- Budget: Annual operating budget of approximately $[amount]
- Staff: [number] full-time, [number] part-time, [number] volunteers
- Audience: [demographic description and size]
- Primary Challenges: [top 3 current challenges]
- Strategic Goals: [top 3 priorities for next 12 months]

Question: [Your specific question or challenge]
```

### 2. Customizing Agent Personalities

You can modify how agents respond by providing context about your preferred communication style:

**Examples**:
- "Please provide recommendations in bullet-point format with specific action steps"
- "I prefer detailed explanations with examples from similar stations"
- "Keep recommendations practical and low-cost given our limited budget"
- "Focus on strategies that can be implemented by volunteers"

### 3. Industry-Specific Modifications

#### Classical Music Stations
```
*agent marketing-director

"We're a classical music station serving [market]. Our audience skews older and more affluent, but we're struggling to attract younger listeners. We compete with streaming services and commercial classical. Our programming includes live concerts and educational content. How can we grow our audience while maintaining our classical focus?"
```

#### Jazz Stations
```
*agent underwriting-director

"We're a jazz-focused public radio station. Our audience is passionate but niche. We want to develop partnerships with jazz clubs, music venues, and cultural organizations. How can we create mutually beneficial relationships that support both our programming and our partners' businesses?"
```

#### Triple A (Adult Album Alternative) Stations
```
*agent program-director

"We program Triple A format with emphasis on music discovery and artist development. We want to differentiate from commercial alternative rock and streaming playlists. How can we create programming that showcases our curatorial expertise and builds loyal listeners?"
```

## Workflow Customizations

### Adapting Workflows to Your Timeline

**Compressed Timeline Example**:
```
*workflow membership-campaign

"We need to plan and execute a membership campaign in 4 weeks due to an unexpected funding shortfall. Our normal timeline would be 8-10 weeks. How can we compress this process while maintaining effectiveness?"
```

**Extended Timeline Example**:
```
*workflow annual-planning

"We want to do comprehensive strategic planning over 6 months, involving our board, staff, and community stakeholders. How can we extend and adapt the annual planning workflow to accommodate this longer, more inclusive process?"
```

### Resource-Constrained Adaptations

**Limited Staff Example**:
```
*workflow program-launch

"We want to launch a new weekly program, but I'm the only full-time staff member. How can we adapt the program launch workflow for a one-person operation with volunteer support?"
```

**Limited Budget Example**:
```
*workflow special-event

"We want to plan a fundraising event but have almost no budget for upfront costs. How can we create a successful event using donated services, volunteer labor, and creative partnerships?"
```

## Data Integration Strategies

### Incorporating Your Station Data

**Audience Data**:
```
*agent marketing-director

"Based on our recent audience research:
- 65% of our listeners are 45+
- 78% have college degrees
- 45% have household income over $75k
- Top listening times are 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM
- 23% listen online, 77% over-the-air

How should this data inform our marketing strategy?"
```

**Financial Data**:
```
*agent development-director

"Our current fundraising performance:
- 1,200 active members (down 8% from last year)
- Average gift: $95 (up from $87 last year)
- Retention rate: 68% (industry average is 75%)
- Major gifts ($500+): 12% of revenue
- Monthly sustainers: 35% of members

What strategies should we prioritize to improve these metrics?"
```

### Performance Tracking Integration

Create regular check-ins with agents using your actual performance data:

**Monthly Review Template**:
```
*agent [relevant-agent]

Monthly Performance Update:
- Goal: [specific goal from previous consultation]
- Results: [actual performance data]
- Challenges: [obstacles encountered]
- Successes: [what worked well]

Based on these results, what adjustments should we make to our strategy?
```

## Community-Specific Adaptations

### Geographic Considerations

**Mountain West Example**:
```
"We serve a geographically dispersed audience across [state/region]. Our listeners include ranchers, outdoor enthusiasts, and small-town residents. Winter weather affects travel and events. How should these factors influence our programming and outreach strategies?"
```

**Urban Core Example**:
```
"We're located in downtown [city] and serve a diverse urban audience. We compete with multiple media options and face challenges with parking and accessibility for events. How can we leverage our urban location while addressing these challenges?"
```

### Cultural Considerations

**Bilingual Community Example**:
```
*agent program-director

"Our community is 40% Spanish-speaking, and we want to better serve this audience. We have some bilingual staff but limited Spanish-language programming experience. How can we develop culturally appropriate programming that serves both English and Spanish speakers?"
```

**University Town Example**:
```
*agent marketing-director

"We serve a university town where 30% of the population turns over every 4 years due to students. How can we build sustainable audience relationships while constantly introducing new people to public radio?"
```

## Technology Integration

### Digital Platform Customization

**Podcast-Heavy Strategy**:
```
*agent program-director

"We want to emphasize podcast production and distribution. We have good recording equipment but limited editing expertise. How can we develop a sustainable podcast strategy that complements our broadcast programming?"
```

**Social Media Focus**:
```
*agent marketing-director

"Our audience is very active on Facebook and Instagram but we struggle with consistent posting and engagement. We have limited staff time for social media. What's a realistic social media strategy we can maintain long-term?"
```

### Measurement and Analytics

**Custom Metrics Example**:
```
*agent development-director

"Beyond traditional fundraising metrics, we want to track:
- Community event attendance
- Volunteer engagement hours
- Local business partnerships
- Educational program participation

How can we integrate these community impact measures into our development strategy?"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Customization Challenges

### When Recommendations Don't Fit

**Problem**: Agent recommendations seem too sophisticated or resource-intensive

**Solution**: Provide more specific constraints
```
"That strategy sounds great, but we have only [specific resources]. Can you adapt this approach for our constraints while maintaining effectiveness?"
```

### When Multiple Priorities Conflict

**Problem**: Different agents provide conflicting advice

**Solution**: Use party mode for integrated discussion
```
*party-mode

"We're getting different recommendations from different agents about [specific issue]. Can all agents discuss this together and help us find an integrated approach that balances these priorities?"
```

### When Industry Standards Don't Apply

**Problem**: Standard public radio practices don't work in your market

**Solution**: Emphasize your unique circumstances
```
"Standard public radio approaches haven't worked in our market because [specific reasons]. What alternative strategies might be more effective given our unique situation?"
```

## Measuring Customization Success

- Station A: Rural, $200k budget, news/talk
- Station B: Small city, $500k budget, classical
- Station C: University, $300k budget, mixed format

How can we coordinate fundraising across stations while respecting each market's unique characteristics?"
```

### Seasonal Operations

```
*agent marketing-director

"We're in a resort community where our population triples in summer and drops significantly in winter. Our programming and outreach need to adapt to these dramatic seasonal changes. How can we maintain year-round engagement while serving very different audiences?"
```

### Crisis Recovery

```
*workflow crisis-response

"We lost 40% of our funding due to [specific crisis]. We need to rebuild our operation from a much smaller base while maintaining essential services. How can we adapt our entire approach for this new reality?"
```
