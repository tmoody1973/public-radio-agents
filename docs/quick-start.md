1. **Read the [Complete User Guide](user-guide.md)** for advanced features
2. **Study the [Case Study](case-study.md)** to see the system in action
3. **Explore [Workflows](workflows.md)** for structured processes
4. **Check [Agent Reference](agent-reference.md)** for detailed capabilities
5. **Explore [IDE Integration Guide](ide-integration.md)** if you're a developer
6. **Review [Customization Guide](customization.md)** to adapt the system

### üîß **For Developers & Customizers**

If you need to modify the framework or contribute to development:

- **Framework Customization**: See the [User Guide - Development section](user-guide.md#-development-and-customization) for modifying agents and dependencies
- **Build Process**: Use `python3 scripts/build-bundle.py` to regenerate `publicradio.txt` after making changes
