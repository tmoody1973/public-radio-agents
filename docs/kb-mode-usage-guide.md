## üìù **Where to Add Your Own Knowledge**

### Method 1: Direct Context Addition (Recommended)
**Add station-specific information directly in your conversation:**

```
Before we start, here's key information about our station:

STATION CONTEXT:
- WXYZ Public Radio, serving rural Montana
- Annual budget: $180,000
- Staff: 2 full-time, 3 part-time, 15 volunteers
- 500 active members, average gift $95
- Primary challenges: donor retention, limited digital presence
- Successful programs: Local news, bluegrass show, farm reports
- Community: 15,000 people, aging population, agricultural economy

Now, *agent development-director
```

### Method 2: Create a Station Profile Document
**Create a comprehensive station profile and reference it:**

```
I'm uploading our station profile document that contains:
- Our mission and community focus
- Current financial situation and goals
- Audience demographics and preferences  
- Programming lineup and performance
- Staff capabilities and constraints
- Past campaign results and lessons learned
- Community partnerships and relationships

Please review this context before we begin planning.

*agent marketing-director
```

### Method 3: Add Information During Conversations
**Provide context as you work with agents:**

```
*agent development-director

I need help with donor retention. Here's our specific situation:
- Lost 15% of members last year
- Average member age is 67
- Most successful appeals focus on local news coverage
- Email open rates are 23%, but only 8% click through
- Our best donors attend our annual concert series
- We struggle with monthly giving (only 12% of members)

What strategies would work best for our situation?
```

### Method 4: Use MCP Integration (Advanced)
**For stations with technical capability, connect real data:**

```
I've set up MCP integration with our donor database and campaign files. 
The agents now have access to:
- Complete donor history and giving patterns
- Past campaign materials and performance data
- Email marketing metrics and engagement data
- Programming performance and audience feedback

*agent development-director - analyze our donor retention patterns
```
