## üöÄ Best Practices for IDE Integration

### Context Switching
- Use different agents as your development focus changes
- Marketing Director for frontend/UX decisions
- Development Director for donor/member features
- Program Director for content management systems  
- Underwriting Director for sponsor/business features

### Documentation Integration
- Generate technical specs with public radio expertise
- Create user stories from public radio professional perspectives
- Build testing scenarios that reflect real station operations

### Code Review Enhancement
- Ask agents to review features for public radio appropriateness
- Verify compliance considerations are addressed
- Ensure accessibility and community service alignment

### Project Planning
- Use workflows for major development projects
- Get multi-agent input for complex system design decisions
- Align technical choices with station strategic goals

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy Considerations

### Code Privacy
- Agents work within your IDE environment
- No code is shared externally beyond what you explicitly provide
- Consider using local LLMs for maximum privacy

### Station Data Protection
- Don't paste actual donor/member data into AI chats
- Use anonymized examples when discussing data structures
- Follow your station's data governance policies

### Compliance Integration
- Agents understand FCC and public radio regulations
- Always verify compliance requirements with legal counsel
- Use agents for guidance, not as legal authority

## üìö IDE Resources and Documentation

### Quick Reference Commands
- `*help` - Show all available agents and workflows
- `*agent [name]` - Switch to specialist agent
- `*workflow [name]` - Start structured development process  
- `*party-mode` - Multi-agent collaboration for complex decisions

### Specialized Development Queries
- Database design and schema questions
- User experience and accessibility considerations  
- Integration requirements and API design
- Performance optimization for public radio use cases
- Compliance and regulatory requirement integration

The IDE integration approach gives technical public radio professionals the power to combine their development skills with deep public radio expertise, creating better systems that truly serve station missions and community needs.
